# Tyms Homebrew

This is a file that you can use to access some of the homebrew items and spells we have been given in "Tyms" in 5etools.

## How to load the homebrew in 5etools
1. Go to 5etools (either version should be fine, though I recommend using the 2014 version of the site).
2. Click "Utilities" in the top bar, then click "Homebrew Manager"
3. On that page, click "Load from URL" near the top.
4. Paste "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bananapants22/tyms-homebrew/refs/heads/main/Tym%3B%20Tyms.json" (without the quotation marks) into that box and click "OK".
5. You should now be able to search for items from the game in 5etools :)

### Updating the homebrew
Hopefully, 5etools would automatically update the homebrew when I update it, however that may not work. If you need to manually update the homebrew:
1. First, go back to the 5etools "Homebrew Manager" page.
2. Then, either click "Update All" near the top, or click the little update icon near the far right of the entry for "Tyms" in your homebrew list. It looks like this: <img width="30" height="30" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c50d6ec-1c42-4f76-a599-8da08b6f91cf" />
